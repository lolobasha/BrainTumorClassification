# BrainTumorClassification
Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells within the brain that can be either benign or malignant. They are a serious health concern, with increasing incidence rates worldwide. The process of detecting brain tumors typically involves medical imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans. Early detection and classification of brain tumors are critical in determining the appropriate treatment method, optimizing patient outcomes, and ultimately saving lives. 

Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently emerged as a promising tool for improving the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor classification. Machine learning, a subset of AI, includes mathematical algorithms that learn from input data to develop the capacity to generate predictions without being explicitly trained to do so. In the context of medical imaging, machine learning algorithms can be trained using large datasets of labeled images to classify images into different categories, such as the presence of a tumor or the type of tumor. In this paper, we present a novel approach to brain tumor image classification using artificial intelligence. Our method focuses on using a multi-dataset approach to increase the robustness of our model and improve accuracy across different datasets. Specifically, we combine three different datasets, each containing unique brain MRI images, to make the classification more challenging and ensure that the higher accuracy would apply to different datasets. Our combined dataset of Brain Tumor Image Classification contains images of human brain MRI images which are classified into 4 classes: glioma - meningioma - no tumor and pituitary.

The importance of early detection and accurate classification of brain tumors cannot be overstated. In 2019, there were 347,992 (262,084â€“388,896) global cases of brain and CNS cancers, which showed a significant increase (94.35%) from the period between 1990 to 2019, and the numbers are increasing (Fan et al., 2022). The ability to accurately classify brain tumors will enable medical professionals to make informed decisions about treatment options, leading to better patient outcomes and potentially saving lives. 

To achieve this goal, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN), a special type of artificial neural network that uses deep learning algorithms. CNNs have been widely used in image and video recognition due to their high performance in recognizing patterns. In our study, we aim to subclassify brain tumor images into different categories using a CNN model trained on our multi-dataset approach. We believe that our approach has the potential to significantly impact the field of medical imaging and improve patient outcomes for those with brain tumors.
